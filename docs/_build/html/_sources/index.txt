What is CrossMap ?
====================

* CrossMap is a program for convenient conversion of genome coordinates (or annotation files)
  between *different assemblies* (such as Human `hg18 (NCBI36) <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/2928/>`_
  <> `hg19 (GRCh37) <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/2758/>`_, Mouse `mm9 (MGSCv37) <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/165668/>`_
  <> `mm10 (GRCm38) <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/327618/>`_). 
* It supports most commonly used file formats including SAM/BAM, Wiggle/BigWig, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF.
* CrossMap is designed to liftover genome coordinates between assemblies. It's *not* a program
  for aligning sequences to reference genome.
* We *do not* recommend using CrossMap to convert genome coordinates between species.

Why CrossMap ?
===================

Full genome sequencing, especially mammalian (eg. human) genomes, requires extensive, continuous
efforts. Therefore reference genome assemblies are subject to change and refinement from time
to time. Generally, researchers need to convert results that have been analyzed according to
old assemblies to newer versions or *vice versa*,  to facilitate meta-analysis, direct comparison
as well as data integration and visualization.

Several useful conversion tools have been developed:

* `UCSC liftover tool <http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver>`_ only supports BED input.
* `NCBI remap <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap>`_ support BED, GFF, GTF, VCF, etc
* `Galaxy <https://usegalaxy.org/>`_ (Based on UCSC liftover tool) supports BED, GFF, GTF input.
* `Ensembl assembly converter <http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/AssemblyConverter?db=core>`_
  supports BED, GFF, GTF, PSL input, but output is GFF only. (**Update:** The original "assembly converter" has been retired. Starting from 2015, Ensembl uses `CrossMap <http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/AssemblyConverter?db=core>`_ to perform genome coordinate conversion.)
* `pyliftover <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyliftover>`_ "only does conversion of point
  coordinates, that is, unlike liftOver, it does not convert ranges, nor does it provide any
  special facilities to work with BED files".

But none have the functionality to convert files in BAM/SAM or BigWig format. This is a significant
gap in computational genomics tools, since these formats are the ones most widely used
for representing high-throughput sequencing data such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, DNA-seq, etc.

Who is using CrossMap ?
========================

* `Ensembl <http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/AssemblyConverter?db=core>`_

How CrossMap works?
===================

   :alt: alternate text

Algorithm
-----------------
   
CrossMap first determines the correspondence between genome assemblies from 
UCSC `chain <http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/chain.html>`_ file (chain file 
describes the pair-wise alignments between two genomes). Genome intervals will be stored in
`interval tree <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree>`_ data structure, 
which  allows one to efficiently find all intervals that overlap with any given interval or point.
Then CrossMap remaps each entry in BAM/SAM, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF file to the target assembly by querying the `interval tree <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree>`_.
Exon/intron structure in BED file; spliced alignments, paired alignments, insert size, header
section, SAM flags in BAM/SAM file; reference alleles, indels in VCF file will be processed
properly.

For Wiggle/BigWig format files, line-by-line computation will be very slow. To increase speed,
CrossMap groups consecutive coordinates with the same coverage score into bins (i.e. genomic regions),
then remaps those regions one-by-one to the target assembly by querying the interval tree.  In other words, Wiggle/BigWig files will
be converted into `bedGraph <http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html>`_ format
internally, which will be converted into BigWig format (if UCSC’s '`wigToBigWig <http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/>`_'
executable exists and is callable).

Time complexity
-----------------
Assume there are N lines in the chain file. CrossMap loads the chain file first and process
the query file line by line. Thus the space complexity is O(N). For each query region (s,t),
it takes O(logN) time to locate which chain(s) overlap with s and t. Then it takes O(logN)
time to search the sorted ungapped alignments in this chain that overlap with s and t and
calculate the converted values for s and t in the target assembly. So in total it takes O(logN)
time to convert one query. The time complexity is O(logN*M) to convert M queries.

In practical, the time CrossMap takes increases linearly to the size of input file.

Release history
===================
* 09/06/17: Release version 0.2.7:
 
 * In VCF file liftover: fixed the bug "non-standard chromosome IDs were not converted".

* 05/09/17: Release version 0.2.6:

 * In BAM file liftover: fixed bugs during BAM file sorting and indexing steps (works with pysam v0.11.1).
 
 * In BAM file liftover: fixed bugs "the read group type is automatically and wrongly changed from Z to A" (https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam/issues/113).
 
* 10/7/16: Release version 0.2.5:

 * fixed bugs during single-end BAM file conversion.
 
 * Add optional tags to the output BAM file. Details see: :ref:`bam_conversion`.

* 08/18/16: Release version 0.2.4:
 
 * fixed bugs during BAM file conversion:
 
  * When the strand of read changes, the seq filed is reverse complemented and the quality field is reversed. 
 
 * In the output VCF file, if the reference allele field is empty:
 
  * Use CrossMap v0.2.4. Update pysam to the latest version. And make sure chromosome IDs in the reference genome file are in the form of "chr1", "chr2", ..., "chrX","chrY" (but not "1", "2", ..., "X","Y", in this case, pysam cannot index your reference genome file for some unknown reasons.). 
 * to upgrade, run: **pip install CrossMap --upgrade**
 
* 04/13/16: Release version 0.2.3:

 * Same as v0.2.2.
 * Two dependency packages bx-python and pysam do not shipped with CrossMap starting from v0.2.3 .
 * Users could install CrossMap using pip: **pip install CrossMap**. Note: bx-python and pysam will be installed automatically if they haven’t been installed before.

* 11/10/15: Release version 0.2.2: Generate *.unmap files (regions that cannot be unambiguously converted) when converting BED, GTF, GFF files. This version also supports genePred (bed12+8) format. (Thanks for Andrew Yates from EMBL-EBI) 
* 08/26/15: Release version 0.2.1: Very minor change, same as 0.2.
* 08/11/15: Release version 0.2: Fixed the bug that CrossMap will not convert wiggle format files due to name collision with bx python.
* 07/27/15: Release version 0.1.9. For VCF file conversion in v0.1.9:

 * CrossMap uses the indexed reference genome (target assembly) sequences rather than load the entire file into memory. Users could index their reference genome file using **samtools faidx** before running CrossMap, otherwise CrossMap will index it automatically the first time you run it. 
 
 * In the output VCF file, whether the chromosome IDs contain "chr" or not depends on the input format.  

* 05/15/15: Release version 0.1.8: Fixed the bug that CrossMap will output invalid VCF file when the input VCF file contains a INFO field with whitespace.
* 05/04/15: Release version 0.1.7: Address the problem that CrossMap does not convert strand in inversions when input file is BED6 or BED12 format.
* 11/06/14: Release version 0.1.6: Fixed "negative coordinates" bug.
* 08/05/14: Release version 0.1.5: Support compressed (*.gz, *.Z, *.z, *.bz, *.bz2, *.bzip2) wiggle file as input. 
* 05/19/14: add chain files for hg38->hg19, hg19->hg38, hg18->hg38, hg19->GRCh37, GRCh37->hg19. In CrossMap v0.1.4, conversion results of BAM/SAM files can be directed to STDOUT to support piping.
* 12/12/13: CrossMap was accepted by `Bioinformatics <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/12/18/bioinformatics.btt730.short?rss=1>`_
* 10/23/13: CrossMap (0.1.3) was released

   columns. If  no "output_file" was specified, output will be directed
   to screen (console). BED format:
   http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1

 Example:
   CrossMapy.py bed hg18ToHg19.over.chain.gz test.hg18.bed test.hg19.bed
   # write output to "test.hg19.bed"

 Example:
   CrossMapy.py bed hg18ToHg19.over.chain.gz test.hg18.bed
   # write output to screen

Convert BED format files
-------------------------
A `BED <http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1>`_ (Browser Extensible Data) file
is a tab-delimited text file describing genome regions or gene annotations. It is the standard
file format used by UCSC. It consists of one line per feature, each containing 3-12 columns.
CrossMap converts BED files with less than 12 columns to a different assembly by updating the
chromosome and genome coordinates only; all other columns remain unchanged. Regions from old
assembly mapping to multiple locations to the new assembly will be split.  For 12-columns BED
files, all columns will be updated accordingly except the 4th column (name of bed line), 5th
column (score value) and 9th column (RGB value describing the display color). 12-column BED
files usually define multiple blocks (eg. exon); if any of the exons fails to map to a new
assembly, the whole BED line is skipped. 

The input BED file can be plain text file, compressed file with extension of .gz, .Z, .z,
.bz, .bz2 and .bzip2, or even a URL pointing to accessible remote files (http://, https://
and ftp://). Compressed remote files are not supported. The output is a BED format file with
exact the same number of columns as the original one.

Standard `BED <http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1>`_ format has 12 columns, but CrossMap also supports BED-like formats:

* BED3: The first 3 columns ("chrom", "start", "end") of BED format file.
* BED6: The first 6 columns ("chrom", "start", "end", "name", "score", "strand") of BED format file.
* Other: Format has at least 3 columns ("chrom", "start", "end") and no more than 12 columns. All other columns are arbitrary.

NOTE:

1. For BED-like formats mentioned above, CrossMap only updates "chrom (1st column)", "start (2nd column) ", "end (3rd column) " and "strand" (if any). All other columns will keep AS-IS.
2.  Lines starting with '#', 'browser', 'track' will be skipped.
3.  Lines will less than 3 columns will be skipped.
4.  2nd-column and 3-column must be integer, otherwise skipped.
5.  "+" strand is assumed if no strand information was found.
6.  For standard BED format (12 columns). If any of the defined exon blocks cannot be uniquely mapped to target assembly, the whole entry will be skipped.

.. _bam_conversion:

Convert BAM/SAM format files
-----------------------------
`SAM <http://samtools.sourceforge.net/samtools.shtml#5>`_ (Sequence Alignment Map) format
is a generic format for storing sequencing alignments, and BAM is binary and compressed
version of SAM (`Li et al., 2009 <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/16/2078.full>`_).
Most high-throughput sequencing  (HTS) alignments were in SAM/BAM format and many HTS analysis
tools work with SAM/BAM format. CrossMap updates chromosomes, genome coordinates, header
sections, and all SAM flags accordingly.  The program version (of CrossMap) is inserted into
the header section, along with  the names of the original BAM file and the chain file.  For
pair-end sequencing, insert size is also recalculated. The input BAM file should be sorted
and indexed properly using samTools (`Li et al., 2009 <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/16/2078.full>`_).
Output format is determined from the input format and BAM output will be sorted and indexed automatically.


Typing command without any arguments will print help message::

 $ python CrossMap.py bam

Screen output::
 
 Usage: CrossMap.py bam input_chain_file input_bam_file output_file [options]
 Note: If output_file == STDOUT or -, CrossMap will write BAM file to the screen

 Options:
   -m INSERT_SIZE, --mean=INSERT_SIZE
                        Average insert size of pair-end sequencing (bp).
                        [default=200.0]
   -s INSERT_SIZE_STDEV, --stdev=INSERT_SIZE_STDEV
                        Stanadard deviation of insert size. [default=30.0]
   -t INSERT_SIZE_FOLD, --times=INSERT_SIZE_FOLD
                        A mapped pair is considered as "proper pair" if both
                        ends mapped to different strand and the distance
                        between them is less then '-t' * stdev from the mean.
                        [default=3.0]
   -a, --append-tags     Add tag to each alignment.

Example (Convert BAM from hg19 to hg18)::

 # add optional tags using '-a' (recommend always use '-a' option)
 
 $ CrossMap.py bam -a ../data/hg19ToHg18.over.chain.gz test.hg19.bam test.hg18		
 Insert size = 200.000000

3. Genome coordinates and all SAM flags in alignment section will be updated to target assembly.
4. Optional fields in alignment section will not be updated in current version.

Convert Wiggle/BigWig format files
-----------------------------------
`Wiggle <http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html>`_ (WIG) format is useful for
displaying continuous data such as GC content and reads intensity of high-throughput sequencing data.
BigWig is a self-indexed binary-format Wiggle file, and has the advantage of supporting random access.
This means only regions that need to be displayed are retrieved by genome browser, and it dramatically
reduces the time needed for data transferring (`Kent et al., 2010 <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/17/2204.long>`_).
Input wiggle data can be in variableStep (for data with irregular intervals) or fixedStep
(for data with regular intervals). Regardless of the input, the output will always in bedGraph
format. bedGraph format is similar to wiggle format and can be converted into BigWig format
using UCSC `wigToBigWig <http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/>`_ tool. We export files
in bedGraph because it is usually much smaller than file in wiggle format, and more importantly,
CrossMap internally transforms wiggle into bedGraph to increase running speed.

If an input file is in BigWig format, the output is BigWig format if UCSC’s
'`wigToBigWig <http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/>`_' executable can be found;
otherwise, the output file will be in bedGraph format.

(Gene Transfer Format) is a refined version of GTF. The first eight fields are the same as
GFF. Plain text, compressed plain text, and URLs pointing to remote files are all supported.
Only chromosome and genome coordinates are updated. The format of output is determined from
the input.

NOTE:

1. Each feature  (exon, intron, UTR, etc) is processed separately and independently, and
   we do NOT check if features originally belonging to the same gene were converted into the same gene.
2. If user want to liftover gene annotation files, use BED12 format.
3. If no output file was specified, output will be printed to screen (console). In this case, items failed to convert are also printed out.
  
Convert VCF format files
-----------------------------------
`VCF <http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41>`_
(variant call format) is a flexible and extendable line-oriented text format developed by
the `1000 Genome Project <http://www.1000genomes.org/>`_. It is useful for representing single
nucleotide variants, indels, copy number variants, and structural variants. Chromosomes,
coordinates, and reference alleles are updated to a new assembly, and all the other fields
are not changed.

Typing command without any arguments will print help message::

 $ python2.7 CrossMap.py  vcf

Screen output::

 usage:
   CrossMap.py vcf input_chain_file input_VCF_file ref_genome_file output_file

 Description:
   "input_chain_file" and "input_VCF_file" can be regular or compressed (*.gz, *.Z,
   *.z, *.bz, *.bz2, *.bzip2) file, local file or URL (http://, https://, ftp://)
   pointing to remote file. "ref_genome_file" is genome sequence file of 'target
   assembly' in FASTA foramt.

 Example:
   CrossMap.py vcf hg19ToHg18.over.chain.gz test.hg19.vcf hg18.fa test.hg18.vcf
   
Example (Convert VCF file from hg19 to hg18)::

NOTE:

1. Genome coordinates and reference allele will be updated to target assembly.
2. Reference genome is genome sequence of target assembly.
3. If the reference genome sequence file (../database/genome/hg18.fa) was not indexed, CrossMap will automatically indexed it (only the first time you run CrossMap). 
4. Output files: *output_file* and *output_file.unmap*. 
5. In the output VCF file, whether the chromosome IDs contain "chr" or not depends on the format of the input VCF file. 


Compare to UCSC liftover tool
=======================================

To access the accuracy of CrossMap, we randomly generated 10,000 genome intervals (download from `here <https://sourceforge.net/projects/crossmap/files/hg19.rand.bed.gz/download>`_) with the
fixed interval size of 200 bp from hg19. Then we converted them into hg18 using CrossMap
and `UCSC liftover tool <http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver>`_ with default configurations. We compare CrossMap
to `UCSC liftover tool <http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver>`_ because it is the most widely
used tool to convert genome coordinates.

CrossMap failed to convert 613 intervals, and UCSC liftover tool failed to convert 614
intervals. All failed intervals are exactly the same except one region (chr2 90542908 90543108).
UCSC failed to convert it because this region needs to be split twice:

==========================   ===========================   ====================================
Original (hg19)              Split (hg19)                  Target (hg18)
==========================   ===========================   ====================================
chr2 90542908  90543108 -    chr2 90542908 90542933 -      chr2    89906445        89906470 -
chr2 90542908  90543108 -    chr2 90542933 90543001 -      chr2    87414583        87414651 -
chr2 90542908  90543108 -    chr2 90543010 90543108 -      chr2    87414276        87414374 -
==========================   ===========================   ====================================

For genome intervals that were successfully converted to hg18, the start and end coordinates are
exactly the same between UCSC conversion and CrossMap conversion.
